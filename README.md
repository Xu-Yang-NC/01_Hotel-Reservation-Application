# Hotel-Reserviation-Application

-Overview:

The hotel reservation application will allow customers to find and book a hotel room based on room availability. This project will demonstrate how to design classes using OOP, organize and process data with collections, and use common Java types.


-Main Components of the App:
1. CLI for the User Interface. Using the Command Line Interface for the user interface. For this, it needs to have Java monitor the CLI for user input, so the user can enter commands to search for available rooms, book rooms, and so on.
2. Java code. The second main component is the Java code itselfâ€”this is where to add the business logic for the app.
3. Java collections. Finally, using Java collections for in-memory storage of the data which needs for the app, such as the users' names, room availability, and so on.

-Application Architecture:
1. User interface (UI), including a main menu for the users who want to book a room, and an admin menu for administrative functions.
2. Resources will act as our Application Programming Interface (API) to the UI.
3. Services will communicate with the resources, and each other, to build the business logic necessary to provide feedback to the UI.
4. Data models will be used to represent the domain that using within the system (e.g., rooms, reservations, and customers).
